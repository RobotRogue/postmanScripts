# postmanScripts
Helpers and examples I find useful when using Postman for QA testing.

## assertions.js
`assertions.js` contains various status code, response time, and json validations that I have needed so far while using Postman.  

## preReqScripts.js 
`preReqSripts.js` contains examples of helpers that I've found or written to setup tests with variable data, or sending other API calls that a test will occasionally depend on. These are helpful for integration testing as well, to ensure that your tests should generally be able to run without data dependencies.  

## workflows
This folder contains some examples of test workflows, this is mostly for my own information, as a reference for workflows I wrote in the past. This folder isn't as well maintained. Sorry.
